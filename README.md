# SeedRuler

We are dedicated to the in-depth exploration of automated evaluation of rice seed germination rate and provide a variety of pre-trained models. Our commitment lies in delivering fast, accurate, and convenient automated measurements to researchers and breeding institutions, offering robust support for their research endeavors.
